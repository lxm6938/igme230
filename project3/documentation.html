        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p class="work_page_para">Although I am used to using HTML/CSS, this project contained its own specific challenges that required me to think outside of the box or consult outside sources for help.</p>

            <div class="grid">
        <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p class="work_page_para">Although I am not a novice with flexbox, it was still an interesting challenge to create a staggered grid of items using this handy css technique. However, after some careful thinking I was able to get it working.

        <h2>Hamburger Menu</h2>
        <p class="work_page_para">Creating a mobile hamburger menu was very difficult for me. After many failed attempts, I was able to adapt a hamburger menu
            codepen code for my exercise, and I am very happy with the result.

            <p class="work_page_para">The most important demographic for my portfolio site, a potential employer expects my portfolio site to tell them a story. What are my interests as a designer? What does my design process look like? Do I seem like a good “fit” for their company? All of these questions need to be answered not just through the copy of my portfolio site, but through the visual representation and interactions of my site as well.

            <p class="work_page_para">Being that my major is inherently competitive, I expect my peers to be looking at other people’s portfolios and learning from them. As one of the largest benefits of being in a tight-knit major, I want to make sure my portfolio is up to par with my peers. As well, being a mentor for the younger classes, I want my portfolio to be used as a guide on how to display my own work.

                <p class="work_page_para">I made sure to take careful consideration when using imagery on my portfolio site. I wanted each image to be meaningful and crry weight. I believe that my University News page dispays this ideal fully. Every image was carefully crafted and considered in order to display my work to the best of its ability.

The contrast of the "Lobster" font on my homepage and the typography I use on my work pages is indicative of this.
